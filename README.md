# Wordpipe

Wordpipe is a Wayland-only GNOME dictation app built around true streaming
speech recognition. The ASR runtime is pivoting to a Rust worker based on
`parakeet-rs`; the earlier sherpa-onnx worker remains available for legacy
diagnostics.

## Direction

- GNOME-first Linux desktop integration.
- Wayland only; no X11 tooling.
- Streaming ASR with `parakeet-rs`.
- Target model family: Parakeet/Nemotron cache-aware streaming ASR.
- No external VAD for the MVP.
- Endpoint detection is disabled by default while raw continuous streaming is
  evaluated.
- Partial recognition appears in Wordpipe UI; committed text is inserted when
  dictation stops.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the current design plan.

## Current MVP

The current implementation provides:

- `wordpipe probe` capability checks for GNOME, portals, and Python modules.
- `wordpipe-parakeet-worker` Rust newline-JSON streaming worker.
- `wordpipe asr-worker` legacy sherpa-onnx newline-JSON worker.
- `wordpipe type-text` keyboard insertion through the RemoteDesktop portal.
- `wordpipe daemon` MVP loop that connects the ASR worker to text insertion.
- `wordpipe hotkey-daemon` manual or GlobalShortcuts-controlled dictation.
- `wordpipe voice-keyboard` global-hotkey dictation into the focused text box.
- `wordpipe app` GTK/libadwaita control window for local app-style use.
- Optional libadwaita/GTK live transcript overlay.

The GNOME Shell extension and top-bar indicator are not built yet.

## Local Development

This workspace contains a mounted placeholder `.git` directory, so the real Git
metadata lives in `.wordpipe.git`. Use:

```sh
git --git-dir=.wordpipe.git --work-tree=. status
```

Run tests:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Build the Rust Parakeet worker:

```sh
cargo build --release -p wordpipe-parakeet-worker
```

After creating `.venv`, the `scripts/wordpipe-dev` wrapper runs the local source
tree without repeating `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m wordpipe`:

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-dev probe
```

Run the capability probe:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe probe
```

Inspect a downloaded sherpa-onnx model directory:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe model-info --model-dir /path/to/model
```

Run offline decoding against a WAV file:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe transcribe-file \
  --model-dir models/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11 \
  --wav models/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11/test_wavs/en.wav
```

Run live partial-only testing with RTF metrics using the Rust Parakeet runtime:

```sh
cargo build --release -p wordpipe-parakeet-worker
scripts/wordpipe-dev listen-test \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model
```

This opens the microphone and prints `partial` and `commit` events without
inserting text into any app. It also prints periodic `stats` lines with RTF,
audio level, and dropped-chunk counts. When the recognizer has a current
hypothesis, each stats tick also repeats it as a `partial` line, so you can see
stable partial text even when it has not changed. Use Ctrl+C to stop.
The default Parakeet runtime takes raw continuous mic audio into ASR and commits
the accumulated transcript when dictation stops. The legacy sherpa runtime can
still be selected with `--asr-runtime sherpa`.
The Rust worker defaults to ONNX Runtime's `all` graph optimization level; use
`--graph-optimization` only for ablations or debugging.
In interactive daemon mode, the Parakeet worker preloads the model before
emitting `ready`; subsequent hotkey starts reset the resident model instead of
reloading ONNX sessions.
Once a Wordpipe profile is installed under `model_root`, `listen-test` and
`stream-file-test` can use `--model-profile compact|fast` instead of
`--model-dir`.

Optimization work is tracked in
[docs/optimization-experiments.md](docs/optimization-experiments.md). The
Sayboard optimization inventory and harvest results are in
[docs/sayboard-optimization-harvest.md](docs/sayboard-optimization-harvest.md).

For model A/B checks on a concatenated LibriSpeech WAV, build a broader sample
with `scripts/build_librispeech_long_wav.py`, run
`scripts/benchmark_parakeet_variant.py`, then score speed and accuracy together:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/score_benchmark_wer.py \
  build/parakeet-variant-bench/highperf-broad-wer-rtf-001.json \
  --manifest build/librispeech-highperf-validation/manifest.jsonl
```

Inspect ONNX graphs and ORT optimization effects:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/ort_graph_diagnostics.py \
  models/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-parakeet-int8-projected-c56/encoder.onnx \
  --json-out build/ort-diagnostics/encoder-summary.json
```

For smaller graphs, or when you are comfortable spending the memory to let ORT
load and serialize an optimized model, add `--emit-optimized --opt-level all`.
The resulting summary makes ORT fusions visible, such as
`DynamicQuantizeLinear + MatMulInteger` becoming `DynamicQuantizeMatMul`.

Run a Microsoft Olive ONNX pass experiment against a Wordpipe model directory:

```sh
MPLCONFIGDIR=build/matplotlib-cache \
  .venv-nemo-export/bin/python scripts/run_olive_onnx_pass.py \
  build/model-variants/nemotron-c56-fixed-shape-ort-extended \
  build/model-variants/nemotron-c56-fixed-shape-olive-peephole \
  --pass-name peephole \
  --force
```

The wrapper keeps Wordpipe's `encoder.onnx`, `decoder_joint.onnx`,
`config.json`, and `tokenizer.model` layout and writes
`olive_pass_summary.json` with before/after node, initializer, size, and op
counts. Olive is not part of the default model-tools extra; see
[docs/optimization-experiments.md](docs/optimization-experiments.md) for the
exact Olive setup and the current pass results.

If you run `target/release/wordpipe-parakeet-worker` directly, set
`ORT_DYLIB_PATH` to the ONNX Runtime library from the local Python wheel. The
`ort` crate's default runtime can hang while loading this encoder on the current
machine:

```sh
ORT_DYLIB_PATH="$PWD/.venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages/onnxruntime/capi/libonnxruntime.so.1.27.0" \
  target/release/wordpipe-parakeet-worker \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model \
  --wav /path/to/test.wav
```

List input devices:

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-dev audio-devices
scripts/wordpipe-dev audio-devices --backend parakeet
```

Try a specific input device. Numeric values are sounddevice indices from the
default `audio-devices` listing. For the Parakeet runtime, prefer the
`--backend parakeet` listing because it comes from the same Rust/CPAL worker
that records audio; pass its `cpal:N` selector or a device-name substring.
When a sounddevice index is passed to Parakeet, Wordpipe resolves it to a device
name before handing it to CPAL.

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-dev listen-test \
  --input-device cpal:0 \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model
```

Record what Wordpipe is hearing:

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-dev record-test --duration 5 --output /tmp/wordpipe-spoken.wav
scripts/wordpipe-dev transcribe-file \
  --model-dir models/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11 \
  --wav /tmp/wordpipe-spoken.wav
```

If the recorded WAV transcribes but `listen-test` does not produce partials, the
problem is streaming throughput. If the WAV does not transcribe, the issue is
audio capture, device selection, level, or model suitability for the speech.

Test streaming behavior from a known-good WAV:

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-dev stream-file-test \
  --model-dir models/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11 \
  --wav /tmp/wordpipe-spoken.wav
```

This should print partials if the model emits them in streaming mode.

For the Parakeet/Nemotron app profiles, the smoke wrapper resolves the selected
profile, feeds a WAV through `stream-file-test`, and fails if no commit text is
produced:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke_stream_file.py --model-profile compact
```

If the profile was built by the Flatpak but you want to run the local dev
command against it, pass the Flatpak app-data model root:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke_stream_file.py \
  --model-profile compact \
  --model-root ~/.var/app/dev.wordpipe.Wordpipe/data/wordpipe/models
```

To smoke-test the installed Flatpak against the same profile and a host WAV:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/smoke_stream_file.py --flatpak --model-profile compact
```

After one full Flatpak install, use the source-mounted Flatpak dev runner for
normal Python/UI iteration without rebuilding the heavy Rust/model-tools
modules:

```sh
scripts/wordpipe-flatpak-dev app
scripts/wordpipe-flatpak-dev model-profiles
scripts/wordpipe-flatpak-dev voice-keyboard --model-profile compact
```

Dry-run text insertion:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe type-text --dry-run "hello world"
```

Create a config file:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/wordpipe
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe config-example > ~/.config/wordpipe/config.toml
```

Run the MVP daemon:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe daemon \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model
```

Use `--dry-run-insertion` to exercise ASR without opening a portal keyboard
session.

When `~/.config/wordpipe/config.toml` contains `model_dir`, `daemon` and
`hotkey-daemon` can run without `--model-dir`. If `model_dir` is unset, the
commands load the selected `model_profile` from `model_root`. CLI flags override
config values, including `--model-profile fast|compact` and `--model-root`.

Packaging templates live under `packaging/`:

- `packaging/applications/dev.wordpipe.Wordpipe.desktop`
- `packaging/systemd/wordpipe.service`
- `packaging/flatpak/dev.wordpipe.Wordpipe.yml`

They assume `wordpipe` is installed on `PATH` and configuration exists at
`~/.config/wordpipe/config.toml`.
See [docs/flatpak.md](docs/flatpak.md) for the Flatpak packaging path.

Run the hotkey-controlled daemon:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe hotkey-daemon \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model \
  --mode hold \
  --shortcut 'CTRL+ALT+space' \
  --overlay gtk
```

For development without the GlobalShortcuts portal:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe hotkey-daemon \
  --model-dir /path/to/parakeet-nemotron-streaming-model \
  --manual-hotkey \
  --dry-run-insertion
```

Manual commands are `down`, `up`, `toggle`, and `quit`.

Run Wordpipe as a voice keyboard:

```sh
scripts/install-wordpipe-gnome-shortcut
```

Then focus any text field, press `Ctrl+Alt+Space`, speak, and press
`Ctrl+Alt+Space` again. In the default toggle mode, Wordpipe inserts appended
partial text as ASR produces it; the second press stops dictation and inserts
no additional final text. The final ASR commit is still logged, but realtime
typing comes from append-only partials.

The current development path uses a GNOME custom shortcut that runs
`wordpipe voice-keyboard-toggle --start-if-needed`. The first shortcut press
starts a resident `voice-keyboard --signal-hotkey` daemon if needed, waits for
it to become ready, and then toggles dictation. This avoids the GlobalShortcuts
portal's stricter app-id requirements while the app is still running from a
source checkout.

For visible logs while debugging, start the resident daemon manually instead:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --signal-hotkey \
  --overlay stderr
```

The Nemotron streaming model emits text on a 560 ms cadence, so several words
can arrive in one partial. To make those bursts feel less abrupt, pace the
already-emitted suffix into the target field:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --signal-hotkey \
  --overlay stderr \
  --stream-insert-delay-seconds 0.03
```

This does not reduce ASR latency. It inserts the first word-like piece from each
burst immediately and then waits the configured delay between the rest. Omit the
flag, or set `stream_insert_delay_seconds = 0.0`, for fastest raw insertion.

When `voice-keyboard-toggle --start-if-needed` starts the daemon for a GNOME
shortcut, daemon stdout/stderr is written to
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/wordpipe/voice-keyboard.log`, or
`~/.cache/wordpipe/voice-keyboard.log` when `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is unset. Pass
`--daemon-log-file` to `voice-keyboard-toggle` to override it.

For the Flatpak build, install the equivalent host shortcut with:

```sh
scripts/install-wordpipe-flatpak-gnome-shortcut
```

To restore the older behavior where nothing is typed until dictation stops:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --signal-hotkey \
  --overlay stderr \
  --final-commit-only
```

There is also an experimental desktop launcher:

```sh
scripts/install-wordpipe-desktop
gtk-launch dev.wordpipe.Wordpipe
```

Desktop-launch logs are written to `~/.cache/wordpipe/wordpipe.log`.

The lower-level GlobalShortcuts portal path is still available for diagnostics:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --mode toggle \
  --overlay stderr
```

If GNOME rejects that with `An app id is required`, use the desktop/custom
shortcut path above.

Use hold mode if you prefer press-and-hold dictation:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --mode hold \
  --shortcut 'CTRL+ALT+space'
```

For a non-inserting test of the same flow:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe voice-keyboard \
  --model-profile compact \
  --manual-hotkey \
  --dry-run-insertion
```

Run the app control window:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe app
```

The control window is useful for local status testing, but it is not the main
voice-keyboard path because clicking the window moves focus away from the target
text field.

To try the other built profile without editing config:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe app --model-profile compact
```

The app uses the same config and portal insertion path as `daemon` and
`hotkey-daemon`. Endpoint detection remains disabled unless `--endpoint` or
`enable_endpoint_detection = true` is set.

If the selected `fast` or `compact` model profile is missing, the app opens in
setup mode. Choose the profile in the dropdown and press `Install` to download
the source NeMo checkpoint and build the selected runtime profile under the
canonical `model_root`. Changing the dropdown also saves `model_profile` to the
normal Wordpipe config file, so later commands such as `voice-keyboard
--signal-hotkey` use the same profile unless explicitly overridden.

## Runtime Dependencies

Install Python ASR dependencies only when using the legacy sherpa worker:

```sh
python3 -m pip install '.[asr]'
```

The local development environment has been smoke-tested with
`sherpa-onnx==1.13.3` on Python 3.14 for the legacy worker.

The default Rust runtime uses `parakeet-rs`. Build it with:

```sh
cargo build --release -p wordpipe-parakeet-worker
```

`listen-test`, `daemon`, and `hotkey-daemon` look for
`target/release/wordpipe-parakeet-worker` first, then the debug binary, then
`wordpipe-parakeet-worker` on `PATH`. Use `--asr-worker-path` to point at a
custom binary.

Download the legacy sherpa 560 ms int8 Nemotron model:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe download-model
```

This writes to `models/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11/`
by default. The repository is:

```text
csukuangfj2/sherpa-onnx-nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-560ms-int8-2026-06-11
```

The legacy sherpa model directory must contain `tokens.txt` and either a single
`.onnx` model for the Nemotron CTC path or `encoder*.onnx`, `decoder*.onnx`,
and `joiner*.onnx` for a transducer layout.

The default Parakeet/Nemotron runtime expects the model layout used by
`parakeet-rs`: `encoder.onnx`, any associated external data file,
`decoder_joint.onnx`, and `tokenizer.model`.

The tested int8 English model is:

```text
models/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-int8/
```

On the current Ivy Bridge CPU, the Rust worker uses dynamic ONNX Runtime
loading. `scripts/wordpipe-dev`, `listen-test`, and daemon launch paths set
`ORT_DYLIB_PATH` automatically when a local `onnxruntime` or `sherpa_onnx`
library is present in `.venv`; the `onnxruntime` wheel library is preferred
because it loads the projected-cache Nemotron encoder reliably here.

### Building A Wordpipe Nemotron Model

Wordpipe has two named app profiles:

- `fast`: FP32 projected-cache model. This is the fastest/most accurate
  validated profile so far and has the largest disk/RAM footprint.
- `compact`: dynamic-int8 projected-cache model with fixed shapes and native
  ORT-format startup. This is the small model option and loads in under a
  second on the test machine.

List profile status:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe model-profiles
```

The app window can install these profiles interactively. The CLI command below
performs the same download/export pipeline for unattended setup or debugging.

Download the source `.nemo` checkpoint if needed and build a profile:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe model-install \
  --profile compact \
  --source models/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-source/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b.nemo \
  --python .venv-nemo-export/bin/python
```

If `--source` is a Hugging Face repo id instead of a local `.nemo` path,
Wordpipe uses `huggingface_hub` and enables `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` for
the download. Building `compact` emits the ORT-format runtime directory
automatically. Building `fast` emits the FP32 projected-cache runtime directory.
Run `model-install` again with the other profile when you want to try it; both
artifacts can coexist under `model_root`. After a successful source build,
Wordpipe removes `model_root/build/<profile>` intermediates by default; pass
`--keep-build-dir` when you need to inspect or reuse those files.

`model-install --source` can also import an already-built Wordpipe profile
directory or archive. The app Flatpak can run the same download/export pipeline
inside its canonical app-data model directory, so normal Flatpak runtime
commands do not need model directory flags after `model-install` completes.
Imported profile sources must contain `tokenizer.model`, `encoder.onnx` or
`encoder.ort`, and `decoder_joint.onnx` or `decoder_joint.ort`.

Select the default profile in `~/.config/wordpipe/config.toml`:

```toml
model_profile = "compact"
model_root = "/home/you/.local/share/wordpipe/models"
nemo_source = "nvidia/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b"
```

`model_dir` still overrides the selected profile when set explicitly.

Any runtime command that normally loads the default profile can also select one
for a single launch:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe daemon --model-profile fast
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m wordpipe hotkey-daemon --model-profile compact
```

If that profile has not been built yet, run the same `model-install` command
with the missing profile name. The source `.nemo` is reused from
`model_root/sources/` unless `--force-source` is provided.

The current high-performance export path is codified as a thin wrapper around
the individual phase scripts:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_wordpipe_model.py \
  /path/to/model.nemo \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-fp32-projected \
  --work-dir build/nemotron-wordpipe-pipeline
```

Use `--force` to overwrite an existing work/output directory. Use `--dry-run`
to print the phase commands without running them. The default profile is
`--profile fp32-projected`, which keeps the encoder and decoder in FP32 and
uses the projected-cache rewrite. This is larger on disk, but it is the fastest
validated local option so far.

The wrapper deliberately keeps the phases separate:

- `export_nemotron_parakeet_optimized.py --export-only` exports FP32 ONNX from
  NeMo and then exits before quantization so Torch/NeMo memory is released.
- `transform_nemotron_parakeet_export.py --no-quantize --projected-cache`
  rewrites the FP32 encoder to use projected K/V cache.
- `build_nemotron_fixed_shape_model.py` specializes the streaming graph to the
  current c56 runtime shape and serializes ORT's optimized encoder graph.

The older compact mixed-int8/FP32 candidate remains available:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_wordpipe_model.py \
  /path/to/model.nemo \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-ffn-fp32 \
  --work-dir build/nemotron-wordpipe-pipeline-ffn-fp32 \
  --profile ffn-fp32
```

In that profile, `transform_nemotron_parakeet_export.py` applies dynamic QUInt8
quantization and projected cache, then
`dequantize_nemotron_matmul_blocks.py --include /feed_forward` rewrites FFN
MatMul/Gemm blocks back to FP32. `--fp32-decoder` is also available only in this
profile as a modest-speed experimental option.

The best compact option is the fixed-shape ORT-optimized rebuild of the
sherpa-derived int8/projected-cache package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_fixed_shape_model.py \
  --source-dir models/nemotron-3.5-asr-streaming-0.6b-parakeet-int8-projected-c56 \
  --output-dir build/model-variants/nemotron-c56-fixed-shape-ort-extended \
  --ort-optimize-final extended \
  --ort-optimize-threads 1
```

This keeps the model around 600 MB and avoids the selective FP32 rewrites used
by the larger `ffn-fp32` profile.

To build the same compact profile from a NeMo checkpoint instead of an existing
int8/projected-cache package:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_wordpipe_model.py \
  /path/to/model.nemo \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-compact-fixed-shape \
  --work-dir build/nemotron-wordpipe-pipeline-compact \
  --profile compact-fixed-shape
```

Important defaults:

```text
left_context = 56
right_context = 6
input_frames = 65
output_frames = 7
cache_len = 56
hidden_dim = 1024
ort_optimize_final = extended
```

The final output directory contains the runtime model files:

```text
encoder.onnx
decoder_joint.onnx
tokenizer.model
config.json
```

For the compact profile, native ORT format is the fastest startup artifact. The
Rust worker automatically prefers `encoder.ort` and `decoder_joint.ort` when
they are present, falling back to ONNX otherwise:

```sh
.venv-nemo-export/bin/python scripts/convert_nemotron_to_ort_format.py \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-compact-fixed-shape \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-compact-fixed-shape-ort-format \
  --force \
  --optimization-level all
```

The wrapper can emit that directory after a full build:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_wordpipe_model.py \
  /path/to/model.nemo \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-compact-fixed-shape \
  --work-dir build/nemotron-wordpipe-pipeline-compact \
  --profile compact-fixed-shape \
  --emit-ort-format
```

On the local benchmark, the compact ORT-format model loaded in `0.461s` median
versus `1.154s` for the same compact ONNX model. The FP32 projected model is
still the best quality/speed profile, but its ORT-format conversion is
memory-heavy on a 16 GB machine and is not the default build path.

The wrapper supports `--start-at` and `--stop-after` for resuming or debugging
individual phases. For example, after a successful FP32 export:

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_nemotron_wordpipe_model.py \
  /path/to/model.nemo \
  models/nemotron-wordpipe-ffn-fp32 \
  --work-dir build/nemotron-wordpipe-pipeline \
  --start-at transform
```

## Live Validation

Validated in GNOME 50.2 on Wayland:

- RemoteDesktop portal text insertion into a focused app.
- Manual hotkey end-to-end dictation with the Adwaita/GTK overlay.
- Live microphone capture reaching the ASR `listening` state.
- Offline decoding with the downloaded Nemotron int8 model.

## Performance Notes

The default runtime is:

```text
asr_runtime = "parakeet"
num_threads = 2
queue_seconds = 10.0
```

The workers feed Nemotron in 560 ms chunks, matching the model's streaming
stride. File tests feed three synthetic silence chunks by default so streaming
models can emit trailing tokens before the final commit.

Metrics report both `audio_seconds` for real input and `processed_audio_seconds`
for real input plus padding/flush audio. `real_time_factor` is calculated from
processed audio so synthetic flush work is accounted for fairly;
`real_audio_real_time_factor` keeps the stricter real-input denominator visible.

On the current test machine, the c56 Parakeet int8 export with ORT graph
optimization `all` decodes the known sherpa English test WAV at about 0.94 RTF
over processed audio with the final flush included. The legacy sherpa int8 path
is about 0.99 RTF on the same test and still misses the trailing "gold" token.

The GTK overlay prefers libadwaita (`Adw 1`) and falls back to plain GTK 4 if
libadwaita is not available. Non-UI daemon paths do not require GTK.

Committed text converts common spoken punctuation commands by default:

```text
hello comma world period -> hello, world.
new line -> Enter
new paragraph -> blank line
```

Use `--no-spoken-punctuation` to insert raw ASR output.
